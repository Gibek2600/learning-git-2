	<h1>Rick Astley - Never gonna give you up</h1>
	<p>We're no strangers to love
	You know the rules and so do I
	A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
	You wouldn't get this from any other guy
	I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
	Gotta make you understand</p>
	<br>
	<p>Never gonna give you up
	Never gonna let you down
	Never gonna run around and desert you
	Never gonna make you cry
	Never gonna say goodbye
	Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you</p>
	<br>
	<p>We've know each other for so long
	Your heart's been aching
	But you're too shy to say it
	Inside we both know what's been going on
	We know the game and we're gonna play it</p>
